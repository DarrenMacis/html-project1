        <h1>My Resume</h1>

        <h2>Who Am I</h2>
            <p>
                I am Darren Macis, the dedicated and strategic Director of Operations and Owner at Macis & McRae Services Ltd., a dynamic delivery and courier company based in Elgin, Moray. <br>

                With a focus on providing reliable and efficient delivery services, we specialize in distributing newspapers across the Highlands and delivering parcels for InPost to local lockers within commercial locations. <br>

                Our operations are robust, extending 7 days a week, 363 days a year, ensuring consistent service to our clients. <br>

                Our company is committed to upholding the highest standards of service, facilitated by a fleet of well-maintained vans and a team of professional drivers, each vetted for their expertise and dedication to safety. <br>

                Although Macis & McRae Services Ltd. was initially established without a VAT number, we have successfully navigated the complexities of business growth, including VAT registration and compliance, under my guidance. <br>

                As the leader of Macis & McRae Services Ltd., I prioritize transparency, efficiency, and innovation. I am currently focused on enhancing our operational frameworks, expanding our service reach, and maintaining compliance with all regulatory requirements. <br>
                
                Our goal is not only to meet the logistical needs of our clients but also to exceed them, ensuring that Macis & McRae Services Ltd. remains synonymous with trust, reliability, and quality in the delivery and courier industry.
